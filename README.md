### Hi there 👋 I'm Allison ☕

- 🏫 I recently finished a Full-Stack Web Development program through BloomTech
- ✏️ Before that I taught Math in China (sadly I'm not fluent in Mandarin, but I do love jiaozi 🥟)
- 🥖 🏃‍♀️ In my free-time, find me trail-running and baking sourdough (sometimes at the same time)
- 👀 I'm looking for a Front-End, UX/UI, or Full-Stack Developer role
